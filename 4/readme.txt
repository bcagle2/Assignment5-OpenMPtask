To compile:
	g++ a54.cpp -o a54.exe -O3 -fopenmp

To run use the script file run54.sh

Note that 2 output files are produced.  output54.txt has somewhat readable results and output54.csv has the results in a spreadsheet format.
	output54.csv
	output54.txt

The script file is supposed to delete these output files before writing them again, but sometimes it doesn't work on Mamba. 

One chart was produced and is named output54.xlsx 

Observations for Assignment 5 are in the home directory.

To compile:
	g++ a52.cpp -o a52.exe -O3 -fopenmp

To run use the script file run52.sh

Note that 2 output files are produced.  output52.txt has somewhat readable results and output52.csv has the results in a spreadsheet format.
	output52.csv
	output52.txt

The script file is supposed to delete these output files before writing them again, but sometimes it doesn't work on Mamba. 

One chart was produced and is named output52.xlsx 

Observations for Assignment 5 are in the home directory.

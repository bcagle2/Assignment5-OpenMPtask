Assignment 5 #1 Observations
Based on the data obtained from this run, the speedup, using recursive is much slower than the technique used in assignment 4.  This was not as fast as sequential.


Assignment 5 #2 Observations
Based on the observed data, the recursive algorithm used in this code is not as efficient as that in assignment 4, or even sequential.

Assignment 5 #3 Observations
Based on the observed data, the algorithm used for this merge sort is much more efficient, especially of threads of 8 and 16 than the code used in assignment 4.  At 16 threads it was 1.75 speedup in assignment 4, and 3.4 speedup in this assignment.

Assignment 5 #4 Observations
From the observed times, the algorithm used in this assignment is almost double the speedup from assignment 4.  It's pretty consistent with a 6.8 speedup over sequential.

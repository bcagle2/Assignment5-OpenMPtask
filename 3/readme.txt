To compile:
	g++ a53.cpp -o a53.exe -O3 -fopenmp

To run use the script file run53.sh

Note that 2 output files are produced.  output53.txt has somewhat readable results and output53.csv has the results in a spreadsheet format.
	output53.csv
	output53.txt

The script file is supposed to delete these output files before writing them again, but sometimes it doesn't work on Mamba. 

One chart was produced and is named output53.xlsx 

Observations for Assignment 5 are in the home directory.
